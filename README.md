## Welcome to my Github profile!

Hi! ðŸ‘‹ Thank you for landing on my personal Github profile. Ever since I found out about tech I have been rigorously learning everything I could get my hands on. Being self taught in Data Science, Software Engineering and Cyber Security, below you will find a list of what I did to grow as a human and a problem solver.

For **General Computer Science**, I followed the  [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) path to free self-taught education in Computer Science. The following succesfully completed courses can be found on my Github:

- CS 50
- Algorithms & Data Structures
- Edx Intro To Csharp
- Edx OOP In Csharp
- UBCx Software Construction
- UBCx Software Construction Part 2
- Java Programming Part 1 of Helsinki
- Java Programming Part 2 of Helsinki
- Automate the boring stuff with Python
- Operating Systems: Three Easy Pieces
- Computer Networking: a Top-Down Approach
- Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: From Nand to Tetris
- Build a Modern Computer from First Principles: Nand to Tetris Part II

For **Cyber Security** I took the following route:

- PWK Labs/OSCP
- Virtual hacking labs
- All of BurpSuite labs
- TryHackMe
- HackTheBox
- CyberSecLabs
- OTW Bandit

For **Machine Learning** I have taken the following courses:
- Data Analysis with Python 2023-2024 (University of Helsinki)
- Linear Algebra for Machine Learning and Data Science (Deeplearning.ai)
- Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification (Deeplearning.ai)
- IBM's Machine Learning with Python


ðŸŒ± What I love about tech is the logic and the enormous possibilities it presents us as humanity.
